<b>italics.</b> Printing a passage in italics, like underlining one in a letter, is a primitive way of soliciting attention. The practised writer is aware that his business is to secure prominence for what he regards as the essence of his communication by so marshalling his sentences that they shall lead up to a climax, or group  themselves round a centre, or be worded with different degress of impressiveness as the need of emphasis varies; he knows too that it is an insult to the reader's intelligence to admonish him periodically by a change of type that he must now be on the alert. The true uses of italics are very different from that of recommending to attention whole sentences whose importance, if they <i>are</i> important, ought to be plain without them. And these real uses a definite enough to admit classification. Some of them may be merely mentioned as needing no remark: a whole piece may be in italics because italics are decorative; text and notes may be distinguished by roman and italic type just as they may by different-sized types; quotations used as the chapter-headings, prefaces, dedications, and other material having a special status, are entitled to italics. Apart from such decorative and distinctive functions, too obvious to need illustration, italic definite work to do when a word or two are so printed in the body of a roman-type passage. They pull up the reader and tell him not to read heedlessly on, or he will miss some peculiarity in the italicized word. The particular point he is to notice is left to his own discernment; the italics may be saying to him:

<br>(a) 'This word, and not the whole phrase of which it forms part, contains the point': It is not only <i>little</i> learning that has been exposed to disparagement.

<br> (b) 'This word is in sharp contrast to the one you may be expecting': It would be an ultimate benefit to the cause of morality to prove that honest was the <i>worst</i> policy.

<br>(c) 'These two word are in sharp contrast': But, if a child never <i>can</i> have a dull moment, the man never <i>need</i> have one.

<br>(d) 'If the sentence were being spoken, there would be stress on this word': The wrong man knows if <i>he</i> loses there is no consolation prize of conscious virtue awaiting <i>him</i>. / To Sherlock Holmes she is always <i>the</i> woman.

<br>(e) 'This word want thinking over to yield its full content': Child-envy us only a form of eternal yearning for something better than <i>this</i> (i.e., the adult's position with all its disillusionments.)

<br>(f) 'This word is not playing its ordinary part, but must be read as the word "ー"': Here <i>will</i> is wrongly used instead of <i>shall</i>.

<br>(g) 'This is not an English word or phrase.': The maxim that deludes us is the <i>progenies vitiosior</i> of one to which the Greeks allowed a safer credit.

<br>(h) 'This word is the title of a book or a newspaper, or the name of a fictitious character': The Vienna correspondent of <i>The Times</i> reports that . . . / The man in <i>Job</i> who maketh collops of fat upon his flanks./A situation demanding <i>Mark Tapley</i>.

<br>Such are the true uses of italics. To italicize whole sentences or large parts of them a guarantee that portion of what one has written is really worth attending to is a miserable confession that the rest is negligible.
